	<h1>How to Get Started:</h1>
	
	<p>Depending on which edition you bought, drag <code>Objective-Chipmunk-iPhone/</code> or <code>ChipmunkPro-iPhone/</code> directory into your Xcode project. At that point you should simply be able use <code>#import "ObjectiveChipmunk.h"</code> and go. If you bought the full edition of Chipmunk2D Pro with autogeometry support, you may also want to import <code>ChipmunkAutoGeometry.h</code></p>
	
	<h1>Where to Go Next:</h1>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Read the Chipmunk2D manual.
			( <a href="Chipmunk/doc/index.html">local</a> |
			<a href="http://chipmunk2d.net/release/ChipmunkLatest-Docs/">online</a>)
			It's C API centric, but since Chipmunk2D was programmed in an object oriented style it's very easy to find the corresponding Objective-C API to use.</li>
		<li>
			Read the Doxygen API reference:
			(<a href="API-Reference/index.html">local</a> | 
			<a href="http://chipmunk2d.net/release/ChipmunkLatest-API-Reference/">online</a>)
		</li>
		<li>
			Get sample code from the <a href="http://chipmunk2d.net/downloads.php">Chipmunk2D downloads page</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1>Building Chipmunk2D Pro:</h1>
	
	<p>While Objective-Chipmunk comes prebuilt, we also provide the full source code for those that bought the full Chipmunk2D Pro package. That way if you want to make any modifications or need to debug something you can.</p>

	<p>The easiest way to build Objective-Chipmunk is to run the iphonestatic.command script (or macstatic.command) in the root directory (double click in the Finder or run in the Terminal). This will build the iPhone static library will all the optimizations turned on, and build a simulator build with all the debug options turned on. These scripts will build the ChipmunkPro-* directories as well as the Objective-Chipmunk-iPhone directory if you only want vanilla Objective-Chipmunk for some reason.</p>
	
	<p>There is also an Xcode project provided. The iphonestatic.command script actually uses this same project file.</p>
